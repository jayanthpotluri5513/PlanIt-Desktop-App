## 2. User Registration and Authentication

### Sign-Up
- Users can register by providing their email address and a secure password.
- The registration details are validated and stored securely in Firebase Authentication.
- Firebase ensures the credentials are encrypted and protected.

### Login
- Users log in by entering their registered email and password.
- Firebase Authentication verifies the credentials against stored user data.
- On successful login, the application grants access to user-specific features.

### Persistent Sessions
- After successful login, session persistence is maintained through Firebase Authentication.
- Users remain logged in until they explicitly log out or the session token expires.

---

## 3. Project and Event Management

### Creating Projects/Tasks
- Users can create projects  by entering details such as title, description and due date.
- The information is stored in the Firebase database under user-specific nodes for easy retrieval.

### Updating Projects/Tasks
- Users can edit existing projects by updating their details.
- The changes are instantly reflected in the database and synced across all devices.

### Deleting Projects/Tasks
- Users can delete projects they no longer need.
- Deleted entries are removed from the database and UI in real-time.

---

## 4. Real-Time Synchronization
- Firebase ensures that data added, modified, or deleted on one device is updated across all other logged-in devices in real-time.
- Users always have access to the most up-to-date version of their data.

---

## 5. Notifications and Reminders

### In-App Notifications
- Users receive in-app notifications for approaching deadlines or overdue tasks.
- Notifications are displayed prominently to keep users informed.

### Email Reminders (Optional)
- Email reminders can be sent for tasks/events with due dates.
- This feature can be enabled/disabled in the user settings.

---

## 6. User Interface Features

### Dashboard
- Displays a summary of upcoming projects and notifications.
- Users can quickly access key information from a single view.

### Task/Event Lists
- Projects are categorized into sections such as "All," "Sales," "Developement" etc.
- The lists are color-coded and visually organized for better user experience.

### Search and Filters
- Users can search for specific tasks/events using keywords.
- Filters allow sorting by due date, priority, or category.

---

## 7. Environment Variables
To secure sensitive information, environment variables are used. 

### Setting Up `.env`
Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:
```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your_firebase_api_key>
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your_firebase_auth_domain>
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=<your_firebase_project_id>
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your_firebase_storage_bucket>
